Airport Challenge
=================

I am starting this challenge by having a think about how I am going to set myself up and how I am going to approach it. I've forked the repo, and I've set myself up with this README to keep track of my process and the documentation as I go. 

For the first couple of user stories I followed a simple process of reading the story, extracting a simple user expectation, testing it it irb - watch it fail, write a test in rspec, watch it fail, fix the tests until I have a passing test. 

Story 3, together with the edge cases felt a little different. I made a cup of tea and had a break. I felt that this one might need to be broken down into more parts, so I started with some notes and diagramming and then worked from these. 

From this I wrote some new user stories for each of the scenarios it brought up for me - I will test these, and I think consequently I will have fixed the others at the end.

As I go, if I felt that new test made a previous one redundent, then I removed it.
